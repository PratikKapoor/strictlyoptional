Not in a \u0026rsquo;every GPU is beautiful\u0026rsquo; way, but in a physics way.\nBorn from Sand # Your RTX 4090 started as sand. Actual sand, refined into silicon so pure that only one in a billion atoms is an impurity. That silicon gets sliced into wafers thinner than a human hair, then blasted with ultraviolet light through masks that print transistors smaller than a virus.\nThe AD102 chip in a 4090 has 76 billion transistors. Each one is about 4 nanometers wide. For perspective: a COVID virus is 100nm. A strand of DNA is 2nm. We\u0026rsquo;re building structures at the scale of molecules, billions of them, and expecting them all to work.\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t all work. Not perfectly, anyway.\nThe Lottery # As transistors shrink, quantum effects creep in. Electrons tunnel through barriers they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Tiny variations in the manufacturing process, a few atoms here, a slight temperature fluctuation there, create chips that are electrically unique.\nSome chips conduct efficiently at low voltages. Others need more juice to stay stable. Some run hot. Some boost higher. Same assembly line, same design, different results.\nThis is the silicon lottery.\nNVIDIA bins their chips: the best ones go into flagship products, the mediocre ones get some cores disabled and become lower-tier cards, the worst ones get recycled. But even among the \u0026ldquo;winners,\u0026rdquo; there\u0026rsquo;s enormous variation.\nThe Second Life of Failed Silicon # Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets wild. NVIDIA designs multiple GPU dies for each generation:\nDie Transistors Intended For AD102 76 billion RTX 4090 AD103 46 billion RTX 4080 AD104 36 billion RTX 4070 But what happens when an AD102 comes off the line with defects in some of its 144 compute clusters? It can\u0026rsquo;t be a 4090. Is it garbage?\nNo. NVIDIA disables the broken sections and sells it as something else.\nIn 2024, people started finding RTX 4070 Ti Supers with AD102 dies inside, the same 76-billion-transistor chip from the RTX 4090, but with 54% of its cores disabled. These \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; 4090 chips got a second life as mid-range cards. Similarly, RTX 4070s have been spotted with AD103 silicon (the 4080\u0026rsquo;s chip), running with 43% of its cores turned off.\nYour RTX 4070 might literally contain a 4080 chip that didn\u0026rsquo;t make the cut. Your 4070 Ti Super might be a lobotomized 4090. You\u0026rsquo;d never know without checking GPU-Z.\nThis is the silicon lottery at scale: not just \u0026ldquo;how good is my chip,\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;what chip do I actually have?\u0026rdquo;\nHow to Find Out Where You Stand # So how do you actually measure your chip\u0026rsquo;s quality? You can\u0026rsquo;t just look at benchmark scores. A \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; score might be hiding inefficiencies, and a \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; score might be thermal throttling, not silicon limits.\nThis Works for Any GPU # The methodology below applies to virtually any modern graphics card, not just the RTX 4090. The specific numbers change, but the process is identical:\nWhat Changes NVIDIA AMD Tuning tool MSI Afterburner MSI Afterburner or Radeon Software Typical voltage range 850-1100mV 900-1150mV Clock targets Varies by GPU tier Varies by GPU tier Memory OC headroom Usually +500 to +1500 MHz Usually +50 to +150 MHz (GDDR6) What stays the same:\nEstablish a stock baseline first Track effective clocks, not just reported clocks Calculate clock stretch to find hidden inefficiencies Test in phases: memory → voltage → combined Stress test for stability, not just benchmarks Your optimal settings will be unique to your chip Whether you have a GTX 1660, RX 7800 XT, or RTX 4090, the silicon lottery affects you. The only way to know where your chip stands is to test it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the methodology I used to evaluate my PNY RTX 4090:\nWhy PNY Verto? # When I started researching undervolt settings for my card, I found plenty of results for ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, but almost nothing for the PNY Verto edition. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the more affordable 4090s, which means plenty of people own one, yet the community knowledge just isn\u0026rsquo;t there.\nSo I documented everything. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a PNY Verto 4090 and wondered how it stacks up in the silicon lottery, this is for you.\nStep 1: Establish a Baseline # Run your card completely stock. No overclocks, no undervolts. Use a consistent, repeatable benchmark (I used 3DMark Steel Nomad) and log sensor data with HWiNFO64.\nKey metrics to capture:\nGPU Clock (reported) - what the card claims it\u0026rsquo;s running GPU Effective Clock - what it\u0026rsquo;s actually running Power draw - at high load (\u0026gt;90% GPU utilization) Temperatures - edge and hotspot Step 2: Calculate Clock Stretch # This is the secret metric most people ignore. Clock stretch is the gap between reported and effective clocks:\nClock Stretch % = (Reported Clock - Effective Clock) / Reported Clock × 100 A chip hitting power or thermal limits will report high clocks but actually run lower. This \u0026ldquo;stretching\u0026rdquo; is the GPU lying to you. High stretch (\u0026gt;2-3%) means your card is struggling.\nStep 3: Test Everything # I ran 15+ configurations across three categories: memory overclocks, core undervolts, and combinations of both. Here\u0026rsquo;s the full dataset:\nPhase 1: Memory Overclock (stock voltage)\nConfig 3DMark Score vs Stock Power Notes Stock 8816 - 434W Baseline +1000 MHz mem 8965 +1.7% ~400W Stable +1500 MHz mem 9105 +3.3% ~400W Best score +1750 MHz mem 9056 +2.7% ~400W Regression - memory errors Finding: Memory OC sweet spot is +1500 MHz. Going higher causes error correction that tanks performance.\nPhase 2: Core Undervolt (stock memory)\nConfig 3DMark Score vs Stock Power Notes 1000mV @ 2850 MHz 8555 -3.0% ~390W Too aggressive 975mV @ 2800 MHz 8748 -0.8% ~370W Stable but slower 950mV @ 2750 MHz - - - Crashed 950mV @ 2730 MHz 8699 -1.3% ~355W Stable 925mV @ 2700 MHz 8593 -2.5% ~340W Max efficiency Finding: Pure undervolts trade performance for power savings. My chip is stable at 950mV but only up to ~2730 MHz. The 2750 MHz crash tells me where the silicon limit is.\nPhase 3: Combo (undervolt + memory OC)\nConfig 3DMark Score vs Stock Power Stability 950mV/2750 MHz + 1500 mem 8917 +1.1% ~355W ❌ Failed stress test 950mV/2750 MHz + 1750 mem 8911 +1.1% ~383W ❌ Failed stress test 950mV/2730 MHz + 1500 mem 8948 +1.5% 394W ✅ Passed 20 loops Finding: 2750 MHz looked fine in short benchmarks but failed extended stress testing. Backing off 20 MHz to 2730 MHz provided the stability margin needed.\nStep 4: Stress Test the Finalists # Quick benchmarks lie. A config might score well once but crash under sustained load. I ran 20-loop Steel Nomad stress tests (~21 minutes each) on promising candidates:\nConfig Stability % Loops Result 950mV/2750 MHz + 1500 mem - 8/20 ❌ Crashed 950mV/2750 MHz + 1750 mem - 12/20 ❌ Crashed 950mV/2730 MHz + 1500 mem 98.9% 20/20 ✅ Passed Step 5: Analyze the Winner # Here\u0026rsquo;s the detailed comparison between stock and my final config:\nMetric Stock 950mV/2730/+1500mem Delta 3DMark Score 8816 8948 +1.5% Reported Clock 2553 MHz 2714 MHz +161 MHz Effective Clock 2480 MHz 2693 MHz +213 MHz Power (high load) 434W 394W -40W Clock Stretch 2.87% 0.77% -2.1% Edge Temp ~72°C ~68°C -4°C Hotspot Temp ~85°C ~81°C -4°C The undervolted config runs higher effective clocks on 40 fewer watts with nearly 4x less clock stretch.\nWhat This Tells Me # My card isn\u0026rsquo;t a lottery winner. Stock boost clocks (~2550 MHz reported) are below average for a 4090, most hit 2700-2800+. The 2.87% clock stretch confirms it: stock, this chip is power-limited and struggling.\nBut it responds well to undervolting. At 950mV, it stops fighting itself and runs clean. The silicon isn\u0026rsquo;t bad, NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s default voltage curve just isn\u0026rsquo;t optimized for this specific chip.\nMy lottery standing: ~45th percentile. Below average stock performance, but recoverable with tuning.\nMy Daily Driver # 950mV @ 2730 MHz core, +1500 MHz memory\nvs Stock Benefit +1.5% performance Faster in games -40W power Lower electricity bill, less connector stress -4°C cooler Quieter fans 0.77% stretch Card running clean Not the highest-scoring config (that\u0026rsquo;s stock voltage +1500 mem at 9105), but the best balance of performance, efficiency, and thermals. For max FPS at any cost, I\u0026rsquo;d run stock +1500 mem. For daily use, the undervolt wins.\nA Note on the 12VHPWR Connector # Remember the RTX 4090 melting connector fiasco? The 16-pin 12VHPWR connector (12 power pins + 4 sense pins) pushing 450W+ caused fires when connectors weren\u0026rsquo;t fully seated or wires fatigued over time. NVIDIA and connector manufacturers took the blame, but physics was the real culprit: that much power through such a compact connector leaves zero margin for error.\nUndervolting helps. My config pulls ~394W instead of ~434W, that\u0026rsquo;s 40W less current stressing those pins. It won\u0026rsquo;t save a badly seated connector, but it reduces thermal stress on a component that\u0026rsquo;s already operating near its limits.\nOne more reason to tune your card: longevity. Less power, less heat, less stress on the weakest link in the system.\nThis is part of a series documenting my RTX 4090 undervolt/overclock journey. The chip lottery gave me a ~45th percentile sample. Through testing, I found that 950mV @ 2730MHz with +1500MHz memory delivers better performance than stock while saving 40W. Your results will vary—that\u0026rsquo;s the whole point.\n","date":"19 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/scratching-the-lottery-ticket/","section":"","summary":"Every graphics card is unique, not in a motivational poster way, but in a physics way.
